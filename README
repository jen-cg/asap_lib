# ASAP: A Spectral Analysis Pipeline
## Driver Code

The .py functions in this folder are the primary driver functions of the entire "ASAP package"
The files in src/ are re-written and modified during the various routines of the "ASAP package"

Short Descriptions of Driver Functions
--------------------

- File with constants such as solar abundances, element dictionaries, and the speed of light

handleSpectra.py
- File with functions to read spectra and convert them to different file systems

spectra.py
- File with functions to 'standardize_OPERA': combine, radial velocity correct, continuum normalize

calc_abunds
- File with functions to perform abundane calculations and conversions

line_list_utils
- File with functions to perform a variety of tasks with line lists such as read line lists, trim line lists,
convert line lists to dictionaries, etc.

moog_funcs
- File with functions to perform the bulk of the MOOGENSTEIN analysis, essentially the main MOOG loopers.

user_input_utils
- File with functions to ask for a variety of input from the user
