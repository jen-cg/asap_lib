# ASAP: A Spectral Analysis Pipeline
## Driver Code

The .py functions in this folder are the primary driver functions of the entire "ASAP package"
The files in src/ are re-written and modified during the various routines of the "ASAP package"

Note
____
- These files are being updated regularly.  Update your version of the code by copying Jennifer's asap_lib folder.
Ex)
\cp -R /astro/jglover/ASAP/asap_lib .

(Eventually, I'll create a functioning python package and all this will be easy)

- The config file contains paths to places, such as your data directory.  You will want to change these.

Short Descriptions of Driver Function Files
--------------------
auto_atmosphere
- File with functions to generate a MARCS model atmosphere

calc_abunds
- File with functions to perform abundance calculations and conversions

config.py
