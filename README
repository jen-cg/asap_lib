Developing a little "package" of functions to do this spectroscopy stuff with
- Mainly Colin has very long files of functions and sometimes files have repeats of functions
- I want to collate them all, so they do not repeat and all the functions can be in the same place.
- I also want to tidy them a bit (to my preferences any way)

- Eventually when I do ghost stuff this will form the basis of the GHOST version of the code

Short Descriptions
--------------------
constants.py
- File with constants such as solar abundances, element dictionaries, and the speed of light

handleSpectra.py
- File with functions to read spectra and convert them to different file systems

spectra.py
- File with functions to 'standardize_OPERA': combine, radial velocity correct, continuum normalize

calc_abunds
- File with functions to perform abundane calculations and conversions

line_list_utils
- File with functions to perform a variety of tasks with line lists such as read line lists, trim line lists,
convert line lists to dictionaries, etc.

moog_funcs
- File with functions to perform the bulk of the MOOGENSTEIN analysis, essentially the main MOOG loopers.

user_input_utils
- File with functions to ask for a variety of input from the user

auto_atmosphere
- File with functions to generate a MARCS model atmosphere
