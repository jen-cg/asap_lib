# About the Radial Velocity Templates 

- HD122563.cfits is a radial velocity template used by Collin for the analysis of GRACES data

  - HD122563.xy is the same as HD122563.cfits but in a different format 
  - Wavelength range is 4800 to 6800 angstroms

- HD122563_GhostBlue.xy is a radial velocity template spectrum from the GHOST blue camera
  - Wavelength range is 3650 to 5300 angstroms
  - (was radial velocity corrected itself using HD122563.cfits)

- IDK where arcturus.bin comes from (but it is a relic from Collin's orignal scripts)
